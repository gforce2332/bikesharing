# BikeSharing
#### *Created worksheets, dashboards, and stories to analyze and visualize New York City bike-sharing data using Tableau and Pandas.*

## Overview
This project consisted of presenting a business proposal using data visualization for a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. From the usage dataset, vizualizations were created to see average biking duration trends and the relationships between gender riders as well as popular times.

This presentation was based on New York City but could be applied to other cities around the world with the appropiate data sets.

August peak times for riders appear to be during the morning and early evening.

We see the most popular times people utilized bike sharing were from 7-9am and 5-7pm suggesting bike utilization increased during times of rush hour. We also see an uptick in rides over the weekend days. Both men and women follow the same trend with higher rides during rush hour and the weekends.

Males utilize the bike sharing program more often than females and subscribers clearly ride more often than customers. This could indicate user retention is high and would be a key component in starting a program to attract new subscribers with incentives.

The largest rider age group is 39 though this could potentially be an outlier and would need further investigation. Ages 15-21 shows the largest age group with 60,000 - 70,000 rides.

## Summary
Based on this analysis and visualize we can infer that the most common group of riders are commuters and most likely fall into the subscriber category. The data shows that males make up a larger portion of the riders and could potentially be a point of emphasis when marketing this program.
