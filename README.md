August peak times for riders appear to be during the morning and early evening.

We see the most popular times people utilized bike sharing were from 7-9am and 5-7pm suggesting bike utilization increased during times of rush hour. We also see an uptick in rides over the weekend days.

Both men and women follow the same trend with higher rides during the weekends and rush hour during the weekdays.

Males utilize the bike sharing program more often than females and subscribers clearly ride more often than customers. This could indicate user retention is high and would be a key component in starting a program to attract new subscribers with incentives.
